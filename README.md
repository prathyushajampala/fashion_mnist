Created a committee (an ensemble) of three deep learning models using Fashion MNIST dataset.
The committee of deep-learning models can be formed by combining diverse deep learning models
at the output level. The diverse deep learning models can be formed by varying their architectures.
These diverse deep-learning models can be combined by averaging (or multiplying) the output
probability values. Evaluated each of the three deep-learning models individually and as a
committee on Fashion MNIST dataset and reported their individual accuracy rates along with the
final accuracy of the committee.
